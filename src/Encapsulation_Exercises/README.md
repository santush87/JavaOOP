<h2>1.	Class Box</h2>
<p>You are given a geometric figure Box with fields length, width, and height. Model a class Box that can be instantiated by the same three parameters. Expose to the outside world only methods for its surface area, lateral surface area, and its volume (formulas: http://www.mathwords.com/r/rectangular_parallelepiped.htm).</p>
<p>On the first three lines, you will get the length, width, and height. On the next three lines print the surface area, lateral surface area, and the volume of the box.</p>
<p>A boxâ€™s side should not be zero or a negative number. Add data validation for each parameter given to the constructor. Make a private setter that performs data validation internally.</p>
