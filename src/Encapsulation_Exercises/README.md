<h2>1.	Class Box</h2>
<p>You are given a geometric figure Box with fields length, width, and height. Model a class Box that can be instantiated by the same three parameters. Expose to the outside world only methods for its surface area, lateral surface area, and its volume (formulas: http://www.mathwords.com/r/rectangular_parallelepiped.htm).</p>
<p>On the first three lines, you will get the length, width, and height. On the next three lines print the surface area, lateral surface area, and the volume of the box.</p>
<p>A box’s side should not be zero or a negative number. Add data validation for each parameter given to the constructor. Make a private setter that performs data validation internally.</p>

<h2>2.	Animal Farm</h2>
<p>You should be familiar with encapsulation already. For this problem, you’ll need to create a class called Chicken. Chicken should contain several fields, a constructor, and several methods. Your task is to encapsulate or hide anything that is not intended to be viewed or modified from outside the class.</p>

<p>Chicken lives for 15 years. Chicken has a name for sure, at least 1 symbol long. Chicken producing eggs:</p>
<p>•	First 6 years it produces 2 eggs per day [0 - 5].</p>
<p>•	Next 6 years it produces 1 egg per day [6 - 11].</p>
<p>•	And after that, it produces 0.75 eggs per day.</p>
