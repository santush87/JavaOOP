<h2>Problem 1.	Card Suit</h2>
<p>Create an enumeration type that has as its constants the four suits of a deck of playing cards (CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES). Iterate over the values of the enumeration type and print all ordinal values and names. </p>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<h2>Problem 2.	Card Rank</h2>
<p>Create an enumeration type that has as its constants the thirteen ranks of a deck of playing cards (ACE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING). Iterate over the values of the enumeration type and print all ordinal values and names.</p>

<h2>Problem 3.	Cards with Power</h2>
<p>Create a program that generates a deck of cards (class Card) that have power. The power of a card is calculated by adding the power of its rank plus the power of its suit.</p>
<p>Rank powers are as follows: (ACE - 14, TWO - 2, THREE - 3, FOUR - 4, FIVE - 5, SIX - 6, SEVEN - 7, EIGHT - 8, NINE - 9, TEN - 10, JACK - 11, QUEEN - 12, KING - 13).</p>
<p>Suit powers are as follows: (CLUBS - 0, DIAMONDS - 13, HEARTS - 26, SPADES - 39).</p>
<p>You will get a command consisting of two lines. On the first line, you will receive the Rank of the card and on the second line, you will get the suit of the card.</p>
<p>Print the output in the format: "Card name: {card name} of {suit name}; Card power: {power of rank + power of suit}".</p>

<h2>Problem 4.	Traffic Lights</h2>
<p>Implement a simple state machine in the form of a traffic light. Every traffic light has three possible signals - red, green, and yellow. Each traffic light can be updated, which changes the color of its signal (e.g. if it is currently red, it changes to green, if it is green it changes to yellow). The order of signals is red -> green -> yellow -> red and so on.</p>
<p>On the first line, you will be given multiple traffic light signals in the format "RED GREEN YELLOW". They may be 3, more, or less than 3. You need to make as many traffic lights as there are signals in the input.</p>
<p>On the second line, you will receive the n number of times you need to change each traffic light's signal.</p>
<p>Your output should consist of n number of lines, including each updated traffic light's signal. To better understand the problem, see the example below.</p>
